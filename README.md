# The Go Programming Language

This repository acts as a reference for my learning from the book "The Go Programming Language".

I have read the book through and am now attempting to do a fast run through the book building out some of the
examples so that I may understand better some of the concepts.

I have been working on various go codebases - mainly related to hyperledger fabric. This repo has been started 
to assist in improving my overall knowledge in relation to the Go programming language.
